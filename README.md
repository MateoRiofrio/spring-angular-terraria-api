# Spring and Angular Web Application: Terraria API

## Description:
In this project, we are building a web application that uses *Spring* for building backend features 
and *Angular* to build the frontend as a single page application. Both tools are very popular and together
form a powerful stack that allows for future growth and flexibility. In this case, the main role of the backend is to provide
a way of interacting with JavaScript through HTTP and JSON. Angular and Spring are built as a single application, so if you would
like to run this project check out the set-up section!
